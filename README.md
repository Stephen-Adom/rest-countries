# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with colour theme switcher solution

The Rest Countries API Website is a web application that allows users to search for and retrieve information about different countries using the Rest Countries API. The website has a mobile-first design and uses semantic HTML5 markup to ensure that it is accessible to all users. The website is built using Typescript and Tailwind CSS, a popular utility-first CSS framework that allows for quick and easy styling of the website.
